pgShark
    pgShark - pgShark is a Perl module messing with PostgreSQL network traffic

DESCRIPTION
    This Perl module is able to study PostgreSQL traffic captured from a
    network interface and call various functions for each messages of the 
    protocol. The network dump could be live or from a pcap file (using 
    tcpdump for instance).

    pgShark comes with various sample scripts able to do various things with
    these network dumps. See help page of each of them for more informations.

BINARIES

  pgs-debug
    Outputs the PostgreSQL messages in human readable format. Useful to 
    analyze what is in a network dump before using pgshark on some other 
    duties.

  pgs-sql
    Writes captured queries on stdout. Because of the SQL
    language doesn't support unnamed prepared statement, this script
    actually try to names them. Presently, this script doesn't support
    cursors nor COPY messages.

  pgs-normalize
    The normalize script will try to normalize queries and prepared queries
    and output them to stdout. Its purpose is to give you a list of unique
    queries, whatever the number of time they have been sent by clients and
    whatever their parameters were.
